The concept of example credibility evaluates how much a classifier can trust an example when building a classification model.
It is given by a credibility function, which is application dependent and estimated according to a series of factors that influence the credibility of the examples.
In this work, we deal with automatic classification and study the credibility of an example according to two factors: its attributes and relationships. 
We propose a genetic programming algorithm to estimate the credibility of examples, and then add this estimation to a credibility-aware classifier. 
For that, we model the relationship credibility as a complex network and the attribute credibility using a set of feature selection metrics. These metrics are used as terminals for the GP. The GP was tested in a large number of databases and results showed that the credibility-aware classifier obtained significant improvements of micro and macroF$_1$ compared to the traditional classifiers.
