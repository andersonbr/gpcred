    abstract = {{This magnificent tour de force presents a comprehensive overview of a wide variety of algorithms and the analysis of them. Now in its third edition, <I>The Art of Computer Programming, Volume I: Fundamental Algorithms</I> contains substantial revisions by the author and includes numerous new exercises.<P> Although this book was conceived several decades ago, it is still a timeless classic. One of the book's greatest strengths is the wonderful collection of problems that accompany each chapter. The author has chosen problems carefully and indexed them according to difficulty. Solving a substantial number of these problems will help you gain a solid understanding of the issues surrounding the given topic. Furthermore, the exercises feature a variety of classic problems.<P> <I>Fundamental Algorithms</I> begins with mathematical preliminaries. The first section offers a good grounding in a variety of useful mathematical tools: proof techniques, combinatorics, and elementary number theory. Knuth then details the MIX processor, a virtual machine architecture that serves as the programming target for subsequent discussions. This wonderful section comprehensively covers the principles of simple machine architecture, beginning with a register-level discussion of the instruction set. A later discussion of a simulator for this machine includes an excellent description of the principles underlying the implementation of subroutines and co-routines. Implementing such a simulator is an excellent introduction to computer design.<P> In the second section, Knuth covers data structures--stacks, queues, lists, arrays, and trees--and presents implementations (in MIX assembly) along with techniques for manipulating these structures. Knuth follows many of the algorithms with careful time and space analysis. In the section on tree structures, the discussion includes a series of interesting problems concerning the combinatorics of trees (counting distinct trees of a particular form, for example) and some particularly interesting applications. Also featured is a discussion of Huffmann encoding and, in the section on lists, an excellent introduction to garbage collection algorithms and the difficult challenges associated with such a task. The book closes with a discussion of dynamic allocation algorithms.<P> The clear writing in <I>Fundamental Algorithms</I> is enhanced by Knuth's dry humor and the historical discussions that accompany the technical matter. Overall, this text is one of the great classics of computer programming literature--it's not an easy book to grasp, but one that any true programmer will study with pleasure.}},

        abstract = {{Using gene expression data to classify tumor types is a very promising tool in cancer diagnosis. Previous works show several pairs of tumor types can be successfully distinguished by their gene expression patterns (Golub et al. 1999, Ben-Dor et al. 2000, Alizadeh et al. 2000). However, the simultaneous classification across a heterogeneous set of tumor types has not been well studied yet. We obtained 190 samples from 14 tumor classes and generated a combined expression dataset containing 16063 genes for each of those samples. We performed multi-class classification by combining the outputs of binary classifiers. Three binary classifiers (k-nearest neighbors, weighted voting, and support vector machines) were applied in conjunction with three combination scenarios (one-vs-all, all-pairs, hierarchical partitioning). We achieved the best cross validation error rate of 18.75\% and the best test error rate of 21.74\% by using the one-vs-all support vector machine algorithm. The results demonstrate the feasibility of performing clinically useful classification from samples of multiple tumor types.}},

Fitness is defined using negative test cases that exercise the bug to be repaired and positive test cases that encode program requirements. Once a successful repair is discovered, structural differencing algorithms and delta debugging methods are used to minimize its size. Several modifications to the GP technique contribute to its success: (1) genetic operations are localized to the nodes along the execution path of the negative test case; (2) high-level statements are represented as single nodes in the program tree; (3) genetic operators use existing code in other parts of the program, so new code does not need to be invented. The paper describes the method, reviews earlier experiments that repaired 11 bugs in over 60,000 lines of code, reports results on new bug repairs, and describes experiments that analyze the performance and efficacy of the evolutionary components of the algorithm.}},

@article{Koza10,
    abstract = {{Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;Genetic programming has now been used to produce at least 76 instances of results that are competitive with human-produced results. These human-competitive results come from a wide variety of fields, including quantum computing circuits, analog electrical circuits, antennas, mechanical systems, controllers, game playing, finite algebras, photonic systems, image recognition, optical lens systems, mathematical algorithms, cellular automata rules, bioinformatics, sorting networks, robotics, assembly code generation, software repair, scheduling, communication protocols, symbolic regression, reverse engineering, and empirical model discovery. This paper observes that, despite considerable variation in the techniques employed by the various researchers and research groups that produced these human-competitive results, many of the results share several common features. Many of the results were achieved by using a developmental process and by using native representations regularly used by engineers in the fields involved. The best individual in the initial generation of the run of genetic programming often contains only a small number of operative parts. Most of the results that duplicated the functionality of previously issued patents were novel solutions, not infringing solutions. In addition, the production of human-competitive results, as well as the increased intricacy of the results, are broadly correlated to increased availability of computing power tracked by Moore's law. The paper ends by predicting that the increased availability of computing power (through both parallel computing and Moore's law) should result in the production, in the future, of an increasing flow of human-competitive results, as well as more intricate and impressive results.}},

The relationships between perceptions of website credibility and both message characteristics (e.g., statistics, testimonials) and structural features of health websites (e.g., privacy policy statement, third-party endorsements) were assessed. Additionally, one's Web-use orientation (i.e., searching or surfing) was evaluated as a moderator of the preceding relationships. The results showed a positive relationship between the presence of structural features and perceptions of website credibility as well as a positive relationship between the presence of message characteristics and attitudes about the health topic. Although Web-use orientation moderated the relationship between message characteristics and perceptions of website credibility, the nature of this relationship was inconsistent with study predictions.}},

Research indicates that medical professionals do not author an extensive amount of health information available on the Internet. This creates a possibility for false information, thereby potentially leading ill people away from proper care. One way to begin addressing this problem is to assess perceptions of credibility about information found online. A between-groups, 2 (message type) × 3 (source type) factorial design was tested by manipulating source expertise (high, medium, low) and content knowledge (known and unknown). While findings did not indicate a significant interaction between source and content type, they did indicate an overall tendency to rate all information as relatively credible. In addition, results indicate that both knowledge of content and source expertise affect perceptions of online health information.}},

    abstract = {{Wikipedia is an free, online encyclopaedia; anyone can add content or edit existing content. The idea behind Wikipedia is that members of the general public can add their own personal knowledge, anonymously if they wish. Wikipedia then evolves over time into a comprehensive knowledge base on all things. Its popularity has never been questioned, although some have speculated about its authority. By its own admission, Wikipedia contains errors. A number of people have tested Wikipedia's accuracy using destructive methods, i.e. deliberately inserting errors. This has been criticised by Wikipedia. This short study examines Wikipedia's credibility by asking 258 research staff with a response rate of 21 percent, to read an article and assess its credibility, the credibility of its author and the credibility of Wikipedia as a whole. Staff were either given an article in their own expert domain or a random article. No difference was found between the two group in terms of their perceived credibility of Wikipedia or of the articles' authors, but a difference was found in the credibility of the articles — the experts found Wikipedia's articles to be more credible than the non–experts. This suggests that the accuracy of Wikipedia is high. However, the results should not be seen as support for Wikipedia as a totally reliable resource as, according to the experts, 13 percent of the articles contain mistakes.}},

These range from very centralized information with multiple layers of review, to no oversight at all. Determining which information is credible can pose a real challenge. An experiment was designed to determine whether certain webpage characteristics affect academics' and students' perception of the credibility of information presented in an online article. The experiment looked at five peripheral cues: (1) presence or absence of an identifiable author, (2) presence or absence of references, (3) presence or absence of a biased sponsor, (4) presence or absence of an award, and (5) whether the article is designated as appearing in Encyclopedia Britannica, Wikipedia, or Encyclopedia of Earth. The results indicate that compared to Encyclopedia Britannica, article information appearing in both Encyclopedia of Earth and Wikipedia is perceived as significantly less credible. They also show that the presence of a biased sponsor has a significant negative effect on perceived credibility.}},

Citation and referencing mechanisms often provide the required support for the independent verifiability of facts and, consequently, influence the credibility of the conveyed information. Since the quality level of these references has to be verifiable by users without any barriers, user interfaces cannot pose problems on accessing information. This paper presents a study about the influence of accessibility of user interfaces on the credibility of Wikipedia articles. We have analysed the accessibility quality level of the articles and the external Web pages used as authoritative references. This study has shown that there is a discrepancy on the accessibility of referenced Web pages, which can compromise the overall credibility of Wikipedia. Based on these results, we have analysed the article referencing lifecycle (technologies and policies) and propose a set of improvements that can help increasing the accessibility of references within Wikipedia articles.}},

    abstract = {{The article examines the effect of street address and external links on perceptions of credibility of a Web page. Credibility is a complex concept that has been defined as believability, trust, perceived reliability and dozens of other concepts and combinations. The Elaboration Likelihood model provides a useful theoretical framework for understanding how factors such as the presence of a street address or the reputation of a Web site sponsor can affect the credibility of information on a Web page. A wide range of site-wide factors may affect the credibility of online health information including the quality of navigation and template design and the presence or absence of advertisements and promotional language. Like the presence of street address, links can serve either as tools for central processing of information or as cues for peripheral processing. Information overload and shortage of time are factors that can affect the use of central or peripheral processing by readers from all demographic groups. One hundred fifty participants took part in the study. Materials were pilot-tested to determine whether the two articles in the no address/no link conditions would receive similar credibility ratings and to check the functionality of the WebQ software. Participants' interest in the topic correlated with their willingness to use or recommend information in the articles as well as all six credibility measures}},

    abstract = {{The Internet has become a rich and large repository of information about us as individuals. Anything from the links and text on a user's homepage to the mailing lists the user subscribes to are reflections of social interactions a user has in the real world. In this paper we devise techniques and tools to mine this information in order to extract social networks and the exogenous factors underlying the networks' structure. In an analysis of two data sets, from Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), we show that some factors are better indicators of social connections than others, and that these indicators vary between user populations. Our techniques provide potential applications in automatically inferring real world connections and discovering, labeling, and characterizing communities.}},

The co-citation frequency of two scientific papers can be determined by comparing lists of citing documents in the Science Citation Index and counting identical entries. Networks of co-cited papers can be generated for specific scientific specialties, and an example is drawn from the literature of particle physics. Co-citation patterns are found to differ significantly from bibliographic coupling patterns, but to agree generally with patterns of direct citation. Clusters of co-cited papers provide a new way to study the specialty structure of science. They may provide a new approach to indexing and to the creation of SDI profiles.}},

Opinion and behavior are more homogeneous within than between groups, so people connected across groups are more familiar with alternative ways of thinking and behaving. Brokerage across the structural holes between groups provides a vision of options otherwise unseen, which is the mechanism by which brokerage becomes social capital. I review evidence consistent with the hypothesis, then look at the networks around managers in a large American electronics company. The organization is rife with structural holes, and brokerage has its expected correlates. Compensation, positive performance evaluations, promotions, and good ideas are disproportionately in the hands of people whose networks span structural holes. The between-group brokers are more likely to express ideas, less likely to have ideas dismissed, and more likely to have ideas evaluated as valuable. I close with implications for creativity and structural change.}},
